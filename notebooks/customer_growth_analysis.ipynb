    "\n",
    "## Project Context\n",
    "Digital businesses increasingly rely on customer data to drive acquisition, retention, and performance optimisation. However, many organisations struggle to translate raw transactional and behavioural data into actionable insights that can inform automation and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates how Python-based data analytics can be applied to recent e-commerce transaction data (2023–2024) to identify customer behaviour patterns, support segmentation, and highlight opportunities where intelligent automation can enhance growth and retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is framed to reflect challenges and decision-making processes relevant to modern UK e-commerce and digital businesses.\n"
